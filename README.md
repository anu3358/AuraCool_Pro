# 🛡️ AuraMaster: Sovereign Climate Defense OS (Punjab)

**The first "Triple-Nexus" Urban Command System designed to protect State Energy, Water, and Human Life from extreme thermal crisis.**

---

## 🌍 The Problem
By 2025, heatwaves in Punjab have reached a critical threshold. Most existing solutions are "passive dashboards" that simply show the heat. **AuraMaster Sovereign** is an **active operating system** that manages the state's resource competition during thermal peaks.

When temperatures cross 45°C:
1. **Energy Collapse:** The grid fails under AC loads.
2. **Water Depletion:** Urban Heat Islands accelerate groundwater evaporation.
3. **Human Mortality:** "Wet Bulb" thresholds halt labor productivity.

## 🚀 The Solution
AuraMaster integrates satellite thermal data, IoT grid metrics, and biophysical modeling into a single **Sovereign Command Center**.

### 🛠️ Key Strategic Features

* **⚡ Virtual Power Plant (V2G) Arbitrage:** Synchronizes the state’s EV fleet to act as a decentralized battery, injecting power back into the grid to prevent industrial blackouts.
* **💧 Hydro-Thermal Nexus Engine:** Quantifies exactly how many million liters of agricultural water are saved by reducing urban "Heat Thirst" through Albedo and Greenery.
* **🚑 Physiological Work-Rest Logic:** Uses **Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT)** to calculate safe labor ratios, protecting Punjab's construction and agricultural workforce.
* **🛰️ Sentinel Satellite Audit:** An autonomous compliance engine that uses simulated Sentinel-3 Infrared data to identify industrial buildings violating cooling mandates.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### **The Intelligence Core (`engine.py`)**
A thermodynamic optimization engine written in Python that uses:
* **Genetic Optimization Logic:** To find the lowest CAPEX for thermal mitigation.
* **Biophysical Equations:** To calculate human survival limits.
* **Evapotranspiration Flux Modeling:** To calculate water preservation.

### **The Command UI (`app.py`)**
A high-performance Streamlit interface featuring:
* **3D Digital Twin Mapping:** Using `pydeck` for real-time district thermal visualization.
* **Strategic Sector Focus:** Deep-dive data for **Ludhiana (Industrial)**, **Amritsar (Heritage)**, **Ferozpur (Agri)**, and **Gurdaspur (Border Zone)**.
