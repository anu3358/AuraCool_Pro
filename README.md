### 🏆 Hackathon 2025 Submission
AuraCool Punjab is an **Agentic OS** built to mitigate the extreme heatwave crisis in India. Focusing on the Punjab grid (Patiala, Gurdaspur, Ferozpur), it uses **ExtraTrees Regression** to simulate urban thermal physics and **Fluid Dynamics** to model wind vectors.

### 🌟 Key Features
- **Thermal Digital Twin:** 3D Geospatial mapping of heat islands.
- **AI Health Predictor:** Real-time risk assessment for heat-related emergencies.
- **Multi-Agent Deliberation:** Autonomous agents (Sher & Quartz) decide on policy ROI.
- **Midnight-OLED UI:** Professional dark-themed dashboard for high-stakes command centers.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python (ML Core)
- Streamlit (Interface)
- Pydeck & Plotly (Advanced Visuals)
- Scikit-Learn (Predictive Modeling)
